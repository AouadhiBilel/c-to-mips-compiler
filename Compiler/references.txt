Case insensitive
All English letters (upper and lower), digits, and extra characters as seen below, plus whitespace

Identifiers
begin with a letter, and continue with any number of letters
assume no identifier is longer than 8 characters
Keywords (reserved), include: start finish then if repeat var int float do read print void return dummy program
Relational operators, include: == < > =!= => =<
Other operators, include: = : + - * / %
Delimiters, include: . ( ) , { } ; [ ]
Numbers:
any sequence of decimal digits, no sign
assume no number is longer than 8 digits
Other assumption:
No whitespace needed to separate tokens except when this changes the tokens (as x y vs xy)
Comments start with // and end with new line

typedef enum{
	IDENTIFIER,
	KEYWORD,
	NUMBER,	// isnum()
	RELATION_OPERATOR,
	OPERATOR,
	DELIMITER,
