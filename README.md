# c-to-mips-compiler


Compiler Lexer Coursework
Questions and TODO
1. #include <iostream> , do we need to lex this?
2. Will DT test in this form? cat contents.txt | ./c_lexer > output.txt
3. C++11 ok?
4. Single quotes in stdout? ' '
5. Create makefile

TODO

// Current code works for both pre-processed and non pre-processed
// Code however looks pretty shitty and is fairly confusing
// Refactor if possible
